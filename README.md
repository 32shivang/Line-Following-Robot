Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows either black line in white are or white line in black area. Robot must be able to detect particular line and keep following it.

For special situations such as cross overs where robot can have more than one path which can be followed, predefined path must be followed by the robot.

Input: Read the white/black on the floor and condition the input signal(s) for transmission into the microcontroller in a way that questions can be asked and decisions made.

Process: Based on the inputs received, microcontroller decide what change (if any) needs to be made to the robots speed and direction. Convert the results of any decisions made into something that can be sent to motor speed control and/or steering.

Output: Send the old or the newly adjusted control signals to speed and/or steering devices.
